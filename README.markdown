<h1>Ruby instalations</h1>

<p>
  Its a pain to install ruby devkit especially so I have created a git repo of my local Ruby 1.9.2 and Devkit 
  so you can just clone or download this repo and follow how to upgrade from existing or run multiple ruby 
  versions on your local machine.
</p>

<h2>Upgrade to Ruby 1.9.2</h2>

<p>
  <strong>Download / Clone ruby-kit </strong>
</p>

<pre>
  Update enviroment variable <strong>path</strong> to the new path were you Downloaded / Cloned ruby-kit
  should be like (C:\path to ruby folder\Ruby192\bin) and (C:\path to ruby folder\DevKit\bin).
</pre>

<p>
  Close enviroment variable window and open your commandline type in <strong>ruby -v</strong> you should get
  <strong>ruby 1.9.2p290 (2011-07-09) [i386-mingw32]</strong>
