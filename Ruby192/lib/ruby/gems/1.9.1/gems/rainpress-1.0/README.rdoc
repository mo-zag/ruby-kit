== About

Rainpress is a compressor for CSS. It's written in ruby, but should not be
limited to ruby projects.

Rainpress does not apply common compression algorithms like gzip, it removes
unnecessary characters and replaces some attributes with a shorter equivalent
name.

== Simple Usage

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'rainpress'
  compressed_style_text = Rainpress.compress style_text
